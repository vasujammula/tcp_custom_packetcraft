# tcp_regresion_suite
Scapy is python based packet manipulation tool for TCP/IP protocol and Serveral Application Protocols.
This project is aimed to provide regression suite for TCP/IP testing and network security sanity testing using scapy as base frame work.
This suite provides test cases for several network level attacks.
This suite provides test cases to check the TCP/IP functionality by varying fields in a TCP connection.
we will identify setup of cases which are minimum requirement to  qualify network from basic attacks.
