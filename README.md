# tcp_Cutom_packetcraft suite
Scapy is python based packet manipulation tool for TCP/IP protocol and Serveral Application Protocols.
This project is aimed to provide custom implemenation of TCP/IP tests with varying fields and network securityrelated tests using scapy as base frame work.
This suite provides test cases for several network level attacks.
This suite provides test cases to check the TCP/IP functionality by varying fields in a TCP connection.
we will identify setup of cases which are minimum requirement to  qualify network from basic attacks.

This Suite can be run from windows or linux with customized parameters.
output will be saved and stats will be reported in textual and graphical representation
